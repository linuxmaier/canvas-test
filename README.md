canvas-test
===========

This repo contains material I'm using to test the HTML5 canvas feature with JS.

canvas-test.html is the full featured canvas element that includes a green box which bounces around a industrial looking container. You can modify the physics in the container using the form next to the container. Many bugs currently involve that form; I may fix them someday.
